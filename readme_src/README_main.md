## jaaJBT
This repository contains my building tools for my projects (mainly Cordova) and for now very naive script for syncing these tools across my projects.
### jaaJBT.js
This script provide basic script updating/version checking functionality. Copy this script to your repository and run `node jaaJBT check`. The script loads `package.json` (key _jaaJBT_) and compares regeistered scripts (see example) against __jaaJBT.json in this repository__.

See **[package.json:line26](./package.json#L26)**

### Building tools overview
There are overview of my scripts.
